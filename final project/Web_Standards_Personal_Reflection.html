            <h3>Important Skills Learned in CSIT 121</h3>
            <p>
         This course was my first exposure to Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and JavaScript (JS), which are the foundation for creating interactive web pages. Overall, in CSIT 121 Web Development class, I learned how to structure a HTML document using specific tags, such as header tags and paragraph tags.  I learned at the beginning of the course that the main parts of an element are: an opening tag, a closing tag, and the content of the element. Every HTML element should contain an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. In addition, I learned that attributes contain extra information about HTML elements that you do not want to appear in the actual content of a webpage. The following is an example of a class attribute: <pre><code>&lt;p class="final-web-standards-reflection">Final Project&lt;/div></code></pre> Furthermore, I learned about the concept of nesting elements, which simply means putting elements inside other elements. This semester, I have learned many important skills in HTML, including: writing comments using the hash tag symbol (#), writing a single paragraph using the paragraph tag symbols, writing an unordered list using a ul element, writing an ordered list using a ol element, writing a list using a list item element, creating links by using the anchor tag. Another important concept that I learned about HTML is that I can wrap name-value groups by using the div element. This is beneficial when global attributes apply to a whole group.  Overall, I have learned to structure the elements of a web page in a specific hierarchical order.

         <p>
            One of my favorite aspects about this course was the use of Github to submit all of my assignments. This provided me with a taste of real world experience by introducing me to the steps of checking in code to a source repository.  In addition, this repository can be used to store all of my best accomplishments throughout my CCBC learning journey.
         </p>

         <h3>Future Goals</h3>
         <p>I would like to transition into the information technology (IT) field by participating in an internship.  This internship experience would enable me to apply the skills that I have gained in my first two classes at CCBC. This way, I can master these skills over time and learn new skills related to a specific area in IT. </p>
