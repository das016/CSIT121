# CSIT121
My name is Daveed A. Sumpter and I am a teacher.

This repository is related to Web Standards and it is my first repository on GitHub.  This course focused on the foundations of creating web pages, including Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and JavaScript.
I used this repository to submit the majority of my projects and labs during the Fall 2024 semester at CCBC.
