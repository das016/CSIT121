            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I really enjoy traveling.  I have lived abroad for 5.5 years.  
                I am currently taking two computer classes.  My favorite color is black. 
                I really enjoyed watching the Olympics this past summer.

             I am currently taking a Web Standards course and an Introduction 
             to Computer Programming course online.  In Web Standards, we have 
             learned so far how to evaluate a small content based website and 
             how to publish a website.  
             In lab 1, I am learning to edit and transfer a web document to a web server
             for successful distribution among common web browsers.
