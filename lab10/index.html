            <h1>Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) 1.2</h1>
            <img src="AccessibilityImage.png"  alt="This is a picture of a computer with symbols that represent a variety of disabilities">
            <p>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created an initiative to improve web accessibility (WAI) to make the Internet available and usable to people with disabilities (Nurthen, Cooper, & Henry, 2006). Rich Internet Application Accessibility focuses on creating web content that is usable by individuals with a variety of disabilities.</p>
            <p>WAI-ARIA 1.2 specifically focuses on applying the Accessibility Application Programming Interface (API) to bridge the gap between the semantics or meaning of the web content structured by HTML elements and the assistive technology, such as screen readers, that are commonly used by some individuals with disabilities. By creating accessible web pages that better suit the needs of assistive technology, Accessibility APIs will be able to assist users more appropriately when interacting with elements on a webpage in real time by allowing the assistive technologies to more accurately convey the name or description of objects to users, which will ultimately improve not only the usability of the webpage, but it will drastically improve the overall user experience (Nurthen, Cooper, & Henry, 2006).</p>
