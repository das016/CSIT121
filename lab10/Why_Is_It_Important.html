            <h2>Why Is It Important?</h2>
            <p>
                Accessible Rich Internet Applications suite of web standards (WAI-ARIA) 1.2 provides a framework or a template for developers to improve content on the web and applications by making them more accessible and operable for individuals with disabilities (Accessible Rich Internet Applications (Nurthen, Cooper, & Henry, 2006).  This is done by providing developers with specific markup techniques in the form of roles, states, and properties, which allows the assistive technologies to more effectively process the web content in order to then convey the meaning of the content and how the user is expected to interact with that specific piece of content (Nurthen, Cooper, & Henry, 2006).
            </p>

            <p>One of the most notable benefits of Accessible Rich Internet Applications is that they significantly improve the usability for users of assistive technology by allowing them to navigate and interact effectively with different structural elements of a web page, such as buttons and menus. This ultimately bridges the gap for equal web access and promotes digital inclusiveness for everyone regardless of individual skills or ability level. In the United States, public institutions funded by the federal government are legally obliged to meet accessibility and compliance standards set by WAI-ARIA. Ultimately, this benefits everyone who uses the web because it requires developers to create more user-friendly and accessible web technologies (Nurthen, Cooper, & Henry, 2006).</p>

            <p>As people get older, it becomes more challenging for them to keep up with the pace at which technology is constantly changing and becoming more advanced. Therefore, Accessible Rich Internet Applications strive to make new web technologies easier to use for the general population. It's important to have legislative policies in place that allow technology companies to create standards that must be followed in order to improve access for all people.</p>
